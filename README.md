# HabitTracker

A C# application I wrote using VS Code.
This is a console based CRUD application to track a habbit specified by the user. C# and SQLite were used to develop this application.

# Given Requirements:

    This is an application which allowws a user to log occurrences of a habit.
    Users need to be able to input the date of the occurrence of the habit
    The application stores and retrieves data from a database
    When the application starts,a sqlite database is created, if one isnâ€™t present.
    The users is  able to insert, delete, update and view their logged habit.
    Application handles all possible errors so that the application never crashes.

# Features:

SQLite database connection

    The program uses a SQLite db connection to store and read information.
    If no database exists, or the correct table does not exist they will be created on program start.

    A console based UI where users can navigate by key entry of the given menu

# Challenges

    This is the first time I've used SQLite. The only time I've used SQL before this was a database class in school, but learning how to use new technologies to complete this application which was pretty fun!

    Understanding how a database connects to my application through a connection string and writing sql queries within a C# program was a bit confusing to grasp. But after searching a few youtube tutorials and reading up on how the connection is made, I understand how the technologies come together.
